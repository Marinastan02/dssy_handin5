see in code

1. see in code and terminal printout

2. 0.0000000035371250000000002 Bit/sec (see main.go)

3. it took 8908100 nanoseconds to sign the hash value with 2000 bit rsa key (see main.go)

4. Signing on the hash takes shorter than signing the whole message, as the hash is shorter. So hashing makes signing more efficient. (see main.go)
